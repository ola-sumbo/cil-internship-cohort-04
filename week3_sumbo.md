UX design is more focused on usability testing, user research and stories and is geered toward value for persona involved. 

*Note: you can carry out prototyping here .*

UI design is applying the perception and outcomes from UX into architectures in design like layout, logo (branding) and visual appeal to the development team.

A key finding to solving UX problem is to involve everyone, to get feed back from shareholders, clients and rework where necessary which helps us better define the problem and thus understand it.

# A good UI and a bad one
A good UI incorperates card designs most of the time and a key tip for me is to maintain a hierachy for important features we are interested and do our best to highlight these features; ie make it more pronounced to grasp the attention of our audience.

**Other aspect is UI is content based** as it mostly focuses on the design end from measurable outcomes.

# Some UX laws
UX is based on user experience and perception. To build a unified font for UX we need to consider its our audience (the business is it a game industry or clothing one). who are our targets? a flow chain from product definition <> -> to research & analysis <> -> to design and validation is implemented here.
